### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Return statements- The use of this is to end the execution of a specific function and then return the value to the statement that is signaling that function.
2. Finding errors using the browser console- A good and efficient way to find errors in your code is to run a live preview of the index html file through your browser console. When you do this, the browser console is able to show you exactly what line of code has the error and reasoning why it is an error. This is good for double checking your work and making sure it is perfect. 
3. Specifying a function- A function can be named, or left un-named/anonymous; if you only plan on using the function one time then it does not need a specific name. But, if you plan on commanding a function more than once in your code then you should name that function.
